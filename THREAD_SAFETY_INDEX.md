## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Critical Fixes (Priority 1)
**Deadline**: Before next release  
**Effort**: 2-3 hours  
**Risk**: Very Low (simple Lock addition)

Files to modify:
1. `kimsfinance/integration/adapter.py` - Add threading.Lock
2. `kimsfinance/integration/hooks.py` - Add threading.Lock

### Phase 2: High Severity (Priority 2)
**Deadline**: Current sprint  
**Effort**: 3-4 hours  
**Risk**: Low

Files to modify:
1. `kimsfinance/core/engine.py` - Add double-checked locking
2. `kimsfinance/core/autotune.py` - Add file locking

### Phase 3: Testing & Documentation
**Deadline**: After Phase 1 fixes  
**Effort**: 4-5 hours

Additions:
1. `tests/test_thread_safety.py` - New test module
2. `docs/THREAD_SAFETY.md` - User documentation
3. Update README.md with threading limitations

## Key Findings Summary

### Critical Issues (4)
All in integration layer (adapter.py, hooks.py)
- Unprotected global state
- Non-atomic operations
- Race conditions with HIGH probability
- Impact: HIGH (double-patching, lost statistics, state corruption)

### High Issues (3)
- Performance statistics tracking
- GPU cache management
- Non-atomic dictionary operations

### Moderate Issues (2)
- File I/O without synchronization
- Monkey-patching race condition

### Low Issues (1)
- Module initialization (protected by Python import lock)

### Safe Patterns (1)
- Multiprocessing in parallel.py ✓ SAFE

## Risk Assessment

**For Single-Threaded Applications**
- Risk: NONE
- Recommendation: No changes needed

**For Multi-Threaded Applications**
- Risk: CRITICAL
- Recommendation: Do NOT use until fixes applied
- Alternative: Use ProcessPoolExecutor (separate processes)

**For Web Applications (FastAPI, Flask, Django)**
- Risk: CRITICAL
- Recommendation: Apply Priority 1 fixes before deploying
- Impact Area: Integration layer (activate/deactivate)

**For Concurrent Charting Pipelines**
- Risk: HIGH
- Recommendation: Apply all Priority 1 & 2 fixes
