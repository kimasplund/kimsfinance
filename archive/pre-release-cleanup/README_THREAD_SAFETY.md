## Critical Issues

All in integration layer:

1. **Unprotected `_is_active` flag** (adapter.py:21-83)
   - Race condition in activate/deactivate
   - Risk: Double-patching of mplfinance

2. **Unprotected `_config` dict** (adapter.py:22-181)
   - Non-atomic dictionary updates
   - Risk: Inconsistent configuration

3. **Unprotected `_performance_stats`** (adapter.py:31-267)
   - Lost performance statistics
   - Risk: Corrupted metrics

4. **Unprotected hooks globals** (hooks.py:21-69)
   - Race condition in patching/unpatching
   - Risk: Loss of original function references

---

## High Issues

5. **Non-atomic performance tracking** (adapter.py:250-267)
   - Read-Modify-Write without atomicity
   - Risk: Lost counter increments

6. **GPU cache TOCTOU race** (engine.py:54-76)
   - Check-Then-Act race condition
   - Risk: Redundant imports, state inconsistency

7. **File I/O race** (autotune.py:110-127)
   - Cache write/read without locking
   - Risk: JSONDecodeError, corrupted cache

---

## Implementation Plan

### Priority 1 (Critical) - 2-3 hours
- [ ] Add `threading.Lock()` to adapter.py
- [ ] Add `threading.Lock()` to hooks.py
- [ ] Wrap all global state access

**Files**: `kimsfinance/integration/adapter.py`, `kimsfinance/integration/hooks.py`

### Priority 2 (High) - 3-4 hours
- [ ] Double-checked locking in EngineManager
- [ ] File locking in autotune.py
- [ ] Synchronized monkey-patching

**Files**: `kimsfinance/core/engine.py`, `kimsfinance/core/autotune.py`

### Priority 3 (Testing) - 4-5 hours
- [ ] Add concurrent stress tests
- [ ] Update API documentation
- [ ] Add threading warning to README

**Files**: `tests/test_thread_safety.py`, `docs/THREAD_SAFETY.md`

---

## Risk Assessment

**Single-threaded apps**: ✓ No risk (no action needed)

**Multi-threaded apps**: ✗ CRITICAL RISK
- Do NOT use until Priority 1 fixes applied
- Recommended alternative: Use ProcessPoolExecutor (separate processes)

**Web applications**: ✗ CRITICAL RISK
- Risk area: integration layer (activate/deactivate)
- Impacts: FastAPI, Flask, Django, any ASGI/WSGI app

**Concurrent charting**: ✗ HIGH RISK
- Impacts: Performance tracking, engine selection

---

## Key Findings

### What's Safe
- ✓ Multiprocessing in `parallel.py` (uses ProcessPoolExecutor)
- ✓ No shared mutable state between processes
- ✓ Individual plotting functions are thread-safe

### What's Unsafe
- ✗ Global state in adapter.py (4 variables)
- ✗ Global state in hooks.py (2 variables)
- ✗ Class-level cache in EngineManager
- ✗ File I/O in autotune.py

---

## Code Examples

### Fix Pattern (threading.Lock)

```python
import threading

_lock = threading.Lock()
_is_active = False
_config = {...}

def activate():
    global _is_active
    with _lock:
        if _is_active:
            return
        # ... rest of code
        _is_active = True
```

### Double-Checked Locking (for caches)

```python
class EngineManager:
    _gpu_available = None
    _gpu_lock = threading.Lock()
    
    @classmethod
    def check_gpu_available(cls):
        if cls._gpu_available is not None:
            return cls._gpu_available
        
        with cls._gpu_lock:
            if cls._gpu_available is not None:  # Double-check
                return cls._gpu_available
            
            try:
                import cudf
                cls._gpu_available = True
            except ImportError:
                cls._gpu_available = False
            
            return cls._gpu_available
```

## Testing

After implementing fixes, add these concurrent tests:

1. **test_concurrent_activation** (10 threads, 100 activations each)
2. **test_concurrent_performance_tracking** (10 threads, 1000 operations each)
3. **test_concurrent_configuration** (concurrent configure calls)
4. **test_gpu_cache_thread_safety** (verify cache consistency)

Expected results: NO lost updates, NO race conditions, NO exceptions
