### 2. Volume Weighting Tests (10 tests)

- ✅ Extreme price ranges (0.0001 to 10000)

### 4. Anchored VWAP Tests (10 tests)
- ✅ Basic anchored VWAP

- ✅ Engine error handling (invalid engine)

### 6. Performance Tests (5 tests)
- ✅ Small dataset benchmark (100 points: 0.196ms)
- ✅ Medium dataset benchmark (10k points: 0.379ms)
- ✅ Large dataset benchmark (100k points: 2.172ms)
- ✅ Anchored VWAP performance (10k points: 2.717ms)
- ✅ Performance comparison (regular vs anchored)

## Test Results

```
======================== 60 passed, 1 warning in 0.94s =========================
```

**Pass Rate**: 100% (60/60)
**Coverage**: 97% (31/32 statements)
**Missing**: Line 9 (CUPY_AVAILABLE check - not testable in CPU-only environment)

---

## Key Validations

### VWAP Formula Verification
- ✅ Typical Price = (High + Low + Close) / 3
- ✅ VWAP = Σ(Typical Price × Volume) / Σ(Volume)
- ✅ Cumulative from start (not rolling window)

### Volume Weighting Behavior
- ✅ High volume periods weighted more heavily
- ✅ Low volume periods have less influence
- ✅ Equal volumes → simple cumulative average
- ✅ Scaling invariance (multiply all volumes by constant)

### Edge Case Handling
- ✅ Zero volumes handled without crash
- ✅ Negative prices supported (commodities)
- ✅ Extreme ranges (1e-10 to 1e15)
- ✅ Floating point precision maintained

### Anchored VWAP
- ✅ Resets cumulative calculation at anchor points
- ✅ Supports intraday session resets
- ✅ Boolean and integer anchor arrays work
- ✅ Single anchor = regular VWAP

### Engine Compatibility
- ✅ CPU engine works
- ✅ Auto engine selection works
- ✅ Both produce identical results (within 1e-5 tolerance)
- ✅ Numerical stability over large datasets

## Performance Metrics

| Dataset Size | Regular VWAP | Anchored VWAP |
|--------------|--------------|---------------|
| 100 points   | 0.196 ms     | -             |
| 10k points   | 0.379 ms     | 2.717 ms      |
| 100k points  | 2.172 ms     | -             |

**Note**: Anchored VWAP is ~3-5x slower due to grouping operations (expected behavior).

## Known Limitations

1. **GPU Testing**: Line 9 (CUPY_AVAILABLE check) not covered due to CPU-only test environment
   - This is expected and acceptable (GPU testing requires actual GPU hardware)

2. **Coverage**: 97% is excellent for production code
   - Missing line is import guard, not functional code

---

## Recommendations

1. **GPU Testing**: When GPU hardware available, add GPU-specific tests:
   - GPU vs CPU result comparison
   - GPU performance benchmarks
   - Large dataset GPU acceleration validation

2. **Integration Tests**: Consider adding tests that use VWAP with other indicators

3. **Visualization**: Could add chart generation tests showing price vs VWAP crossovers

---

## Confidence: 98%

**Reasoning**:
- All 60 tests pass
- 97% code coverage
- Comprehensive edge case testing
- Performance benchmarks included
- Follows established project patterns
- Mathematical correctness verified

**Deductions**:
