# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual
identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall
  community
* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Showing appreciation for contributions of all kinds (code, documentation, testing, support)
* Being patient with newcomers and helping them learn

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of
  any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address,
  without their explicit permission
* Spamming issues or pull requests with off-topic or promotional content
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting
* Dismissing or attacking inclusion-focused requests or discussions

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, including:

* GitHub repository (issues, pull requests, discussions)
* Discord server (if established)
* Email communications with maintainers
* Community events (virtual or in-person)
* Social media when representing the project

It also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in
public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official
email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an
appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at:

**Email**: hello@asplund.kim

**GitHub**: [Report via GitHub Issues](https://github.com/kimasplund/kimsfinance/issues)
(For non-sensitive reports. For sensitive issues, please use email.)

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.

### Confidentiality

We will keep reporter identities confidential unless:
- The reporter explicitly requests public acknowledgment
- Required by law
- Necessary to protect community safety

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining
the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing
clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the
behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of
actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No
interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with
those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This
includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels
like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent
ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including
sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public
communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or
private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction
with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.
Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community
standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an
individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the
community.

## Reporting Process

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior:

1. **Assess Safety**: If you feel unsafe, contact local authorities first
2. **Document**: Save relevant communications (screenshots, links, etc.)
3. **Report**: Contact hello@asplund.kim with:
   - Description of the incident
   - Date and time
   - People involved
   - Any supporting evidence
   - Your preferred resolution (optional)

### What Happens Next

1. **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt within 24-48 hours

3. **Decision**: We will determine appropriate action based on guidelines above
4. **Notification**: All parties will be notified of the decision
5. **Follow-up**: We will check in to ensure the issue is resolved

## Special Considerations for kimsfinance

### Technical Discussions

- **Be constructive**: When discussing performance, benchmarks, or code quality
- **Show your work**: Back up claims with data, benchmarks, or references
- **Assume good intent**: Not everyone has the same experience level
- **Focus on code, not people**: Critique ideas and implementations, not individuals

### Commercial vs Open Source

- Respect both AGPL-3.0 and commercial license users
- Don't dismiss commercial users or demand free support
- Don't pressure individuals to purchase commercial licenses
- Keep licensing discussions professional and factual

### Performance Claims

- Be honest about benchmarks and performance
- Acknowledge limitations and edge cases
- Don't exaggerate or mislead about capabilities
- Welcome validation and reproduction of results
